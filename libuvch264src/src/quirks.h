/*
 * Per-device (vid:pid) quirk seam for the libuvch264src element.
 *
 * Some UVC cameras need a device-specific workaround that has nothing to do with
 * the format they advertise. Rather than scatter `if (vid == ... && pid == ...)`
 * checks through negotiate(), a single flat table maps a USB vendor:product ID
 * to a bitmask of quirk flags, and negotiate() branches on those flags.
 *
 * The design mirrors the Linux uvcvideo quirk table
 * (drivers/media/usb/uvc/uvc_driver.c) in shape only: a flat array of
 * {vid, pid, flags, ...} rows and a pure lookup. No kernel code is copied.
 *
 * A workaround is enabled by adding one row to the static table in quirks.c
 * (with a comment citing the device and the evidence) - never by editing the
 * lookup logic. Every camera with no row keeps the original behavior exactly:
 * the lookup returns 0 and imposes no limits.
 *
 * quirks_lookup_in() and quirks_limits_in() are PURE functions over a
 * caller-supplied table so they can be unit-tested in isolation with a
 * test-local table (no global state). The production uvc_quirks_lookup() and
 * uvc_quirks_limits() are thin wrappers over the static table.
