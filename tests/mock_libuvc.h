/* Test-only mock of the libuvc API surface the libuvch264src element calls.
 *
 * This header declares ONLY the control knobs a functional test uses to inject
 * behavior into the mock. The libuvc functions themselves (uvc_init, uvc_open,
 * uvc_start_streaming, ...) keep their real prototypes from <libuvc/libuvc.h>;
 * the mock provides definitions for exactly the handful the element references
 * and nothing else (see mock_libuvc.c).
 *
 * Two equivalent ways to drive the mock:
 *   1. Programmatically, from a test linked against the mock object, via the
 *      mock_uvc_* setters below.
 *   2. Via environment variables, for a test that only dlopen()s the
 *      mock-backed plugin and never links the mock directly:
 *        MOCK_UVC_DEVICE_COUNT   integer, devices uvc_find_devices() exposes (default 1)
 *        MOCK_UVC_MAX_FRAMES     integer, frames the feeder delivers then stops (default 0 = until stop)
 *        MOCK_UVC_FRAME_FORMAT   "H264" | "H265" (default H264)
 *        MOCK_UVC_FRAME_MODE     "valid" | "oversized_sps" | "oversized_vps" | "disconnect" (default valid)
 *        MOCK_UVC_OPEN_FAIL_AFTER integer, succeed this many uvc_open() calls then fail the rest (default -1 = never)
 *   Environment variables, when present, win over the programmatic setters.
